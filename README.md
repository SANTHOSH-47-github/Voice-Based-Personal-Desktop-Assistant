Title:
Voice Based Personal Desktop Assistant(JARVIS) using Python

Abstract:

Description of the Project:  
    The proposed project aims at designing a voice-controlled personal computer assistant named JARVIS using Python programming. The prime idea of this project is to allow consumers to control their computers either by voice inputs or keyboard inputs, which will allow them to have easy access to their systems.


The functioning of the system starts with the recording of the voice of the user from a microphone based on voice recognition algorithms. The spoken command is translated into text format and processed to search for some predefined keywords. Based on the detected command, the assistant will execute some predefined tasks such as searching information from Wikipedia, launching websites such as YouTube, Google, GitHub, and Stack Overflow, playing music from the local system, fetching the current time, sending an email, and launching an application called Visual Studio Code. The assistant gives a response to the user using a text-to-speech algorithm. The system is designed in such a way that new functions can easily be added in the future. JARVIS can be launched either from the file manager or by using a desktop icon, making it a complete desktop application. This project can be used as an example in using python libraries in speech processing, automation, and control systems, and can be used as a platform in developing a smart assistant with AI and IoT capabilities in the future.
